# Game Engine (Java project)

The first major java project I've attempted.

I spent hours looking through the java graphics libraries attempting to understand them, aided by approximately 20 hours of online lectures I watched by Marcus Dubreil, mentioned once or twice in the comments of my code, for some of his code that I used. (http://www.marcusman.com)

I have implemented a player character (no sprite, but graphics design was not my priority, so it is now a rectangle, temporarily.) The player can move, responsive to WASD or arrow keys. The left mouse button allows for placement of tiles.
The "map" that is rendered to the screen is customisable through a map.txt file. All of these features allow for scalability and easy changing of code without effecting too much existing code.

Effectively what is complete is a primitive game engine (rendering). You can import 16 bit sprites and move them, place them, remove them etc with my existing code, as I have demonstrated by manipulating the spritesheet created by user "Sharm" on www.opengameart.org:
